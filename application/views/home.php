                  Narelle treated me for a long-standing and severe phobia of snakes. I could not even look at a picture of a snake without my stomach churning. After a very short 10-15 minutes Havening session with Narelle, I felt confident enough to touch and handle a very curious corn snake. It felt warm and soft and not at all what I thought it would. Narelle was warm, generous, confident, capable and thoroughly professional. During my session, I became aware of a sensation of wanting to release all that fear I had been carrying around for so long and with Narelle's support and encouragement, I was able to do so. If you are thinking of trying Havening I would urge you to try Havening with Narelle; she is a wonderfully gifted and empathetic healer. Thank you Narelle.

                  I had a brain haemorrhage, 10 hours surgery and had a clip put in my brain 11 years ago. I was told I would have headaches most days which I did. Narelle used a NLP technique with me by creating a positive image in my mind of a healthy brain which has helped me remain free from headaches and painkillers. To strengthen my image I was put into a very relaxed state of mind. When I think I feel a headache coming on I think of that positive image and it goes away.

                  I went to see Narelle for a specific reason, a specific worry/concern that had been ever increasing in my mind. It had really started to control and stir up my life. I recognised it was all out of proportion in my head, and taking up too much emotional and physical energy, but I didn’t know how to stop it, how to switch it off, how to alter the destructive thought patterns I was having. I had a one hour session with Narelle, which involved talking about the situation and the negative thoughts I was having. Narelle used a technique to remove these thoughts and replace them with positive ones. To embed the positive thoughts Narelle then put me into a deep state of relaxation. It was rather like being in a deep meditation state....As I experienced a deep sense of relaxation I was fully aware of what was happening. The session finished with another short chat focusing on my new thoughts and about the work we had done and how to continue the techniques going forward. Afterwards, I was very relaxed and unconcerned, it was a nice feeling after feeling so much anxiety for so long. I went away and didn't think much about it for a couple of weeks, and just got on with normal life. It was after a couple of weeks that it suddenly struck me, I hadn't given ANY concern or ANY notice even, to the issues that had been giving me great amounts of deep anxiety and sleepless nights for months previously, I had simply stopped worrying about it, or even thinking about it, those pictures had simply gone away, as simple as that. If you have any issues, concerns, big consuming life worries or small ones for that matter, I'd really recommend a session with Narelle, it's like she reset or reprogrammed my thought patterns. It sure beats months of anxiety and endless GP visits for "stress" meds!

            <p>&quot;I was overweight, caused by emotional over eating and not happy. I’ve used the techniques myself. Working through my emotional baggage using NLP and Havening to clear out my negatives feelings attached to upsetting memories. I no longer have the need to overeat. Visualising what I would look like, how that would make me feel. Visualising eating small amounts yet feeling full and satisfied and only eating when I was hungry. Changing the images in your head is so powerful and produces positive results.&quot;</p>

                I felt I had let go of the tensions and stresses that I’d been holding for so long I
                was no longer aware of.  That evening I had the best nights’ sleep in a long
                time. Now when I become aware of getting tense I do the actions Narelle
                taught me and immediately feel the effect of calm.</p>
